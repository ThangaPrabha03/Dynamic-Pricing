Artificial intelligence-Project development-DYNAMIC PRICING
Project phase 1
 
 Introduction:
 The advent of e-commerce and digital marketplaces has ushered in an era
 where pricing is not merely a fixed figure but a dynamic entity influenced by
 a myriad of factors such as consumer preferences, competitor pricing
 strategies, seasonality, and market demand. Traditional pricing
 approaches, often based on static rules or periodic adjustments, struggle
 to keep pace with the rapid changes in the market landscape. Dynamic
 pricing, on the other hand, offers a solution by enabling businesses to
 adapt their prices in real-time, maximizing revenue and profitability.

  Dynamic pricing is product pricing based on various external factors, including current 
market demand, the season, supply changes and price bounding. With dynamic pricing, 
product prices continuously adjust – sometimes in minutes – in response to real-time 
supply and demand. Amazon is one of the largest retailers that uses dynamic pricing. Its 
algorithms continuously adjust and evaluate prices.   
Dynamic pricing lends itself more to e-commerce than brick-and-mortar businesses. Since 
brick-and-mortar stores’ prices are more difficult to change, they tend to set prices that last 
for longer periods. In contrast, dynamic pricing relies on real-time trends and supply chain 
factors. 
 
Objectives: 
    1. Maximize Revenue: Dynamic pricing adjusts prices based on real-time demand, allowing 
businesses to maximize revenue by charging higher prices during periods of high demand 
and lower prices during periods of low demand. 
    2.Optimize Utilization: By varying prices according to demand, dynamic pricing helps 
businesses optimize the utilization of their resources, ensuring that capacity is fully utilized 
during peak periods and minimizing waste during off-peak times.
